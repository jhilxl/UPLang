<h1>Documentation</h1>

"UP" in UPLang refers to the upwards direction, where "high" things are, to indicate that this is an extremely high-level language with very simple syntax and far from direct hardware access as it is written in Python.

The usage is super simple but there are a few things to note as of this version:
1. There are no arithmetic operators.
2. Strings cannot be concatenated and the only way to print multiple strings after each other is by engaging the "PRINT" or "print" command for each, which outputs each string on a new line.
3. This is a very simple language and is extremely limited. It is primarily made as a very basic introduction top programming for absolute noobs who are getting stuck with the basics of other high-level languages. This will help them practice for a short while.
4. The UPLang project is open-source and can be edited by anyone and if a large enough change is seen and approved, a contributer may take that as their own version and rebrand it, making it fully theirs.

<h1>Syntax Examples and Explaination:</h1>

note: commands can be lowercase or uppercase, it is not case-sensitive.

<code>STR x "Hello"</code>  -  STR indicates the declaration of the string, followed by x which is the string name or variable name which can be whatever you want to call it as long as there are no spaces, and then the value of the string must be written in qoutes, "Hello".

<code>INT y 5</code>  -  INT indicates the declaration of an integer, followed again by the variable name and then the value of the integer.

<code>PRINT "Hey there"</code>  -  PRINT indicates the intention to produce text-based/verbose output which can be a predefined variable like x or y as declared above (PRINT x or PRINT y) or a variable of choice that does not need to be given a name like "Hey there" in this example.

<code>INPUT name "What's your name?"</code>  -  INPUT indicates that the program should expect for a user input in response to the text in qoutes and this should be stored in the variable in between INPUT and the qouted text, in this case "name".



This README.md file is by no means a learning resource for those struggling with high-level language basics but gives a short documentation of the usage of UPLang. A text file, "example.txt", attached contains an example for code that utilises all possible commands and letter cases for UPLang and can be ran in UPLang.exe, the official code editor and interpreter for UPLang.
